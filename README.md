# Silent Moon – the music app for yoga and meditation

## Idea

An app that suggests music for yoga and meditation depending on a chosen mood.

Users can register and create a profile, save favorites, view and change their data (password, upload picture), suggest playlists and play music.


## Implementation 

The app was realized with
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS)
- Spotify API.

Because Spotify itself requires a login, the Spotify data is not freely accessible (and a push to Heroku, for example, is not possible). The data is therefore fed from the local storage. This would not be functional in reality.
